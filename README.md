SQR Project
Anime Voiceover
The Anime Voiceover project is a Web UI for visualizing the anime dubbing process. Its essence lies in the fact that the sound engineer records data on recorded character cues in a Google spreadsheet and sorts this data by episode. The developers are tasked with converting data about written replicas in the format of numbers showing how many recorded and skipped replicas a particular character has, as well as their total number.
The stack of technologies that are used in the project:
  Streamlit for front-end
  Python 3.11 for back
  Pytest for Unit Tests
List of concrete quality requirements covering:
  a. Maintainability - we use wide-known frameworks and the stable version of Python.
  b. Reliability - we use different tests.
  c. Performanced - wide usage of asynchronous requests.
  d. Security - we use fuzzing and coverage is more than 60%.
Requirements:
  ● Poetry as an environment and module management
  ● Streamlit for the front
  ● GitHub for repo and CI
  ● Python 3.11
Areas of responsibility:
  Egor Stroganov - core front-end
  Philipp Timofeev - core back-end
  Murat Shaikhutdinov - testing and CI/CD
  Michail Panimash - documentation and performance analysis
  Ilya Mirzazhanov - process organization, requirements building and presentation
